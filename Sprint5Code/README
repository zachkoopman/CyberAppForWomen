This folder hosts my work for sprint five. My work this sprint involved setting up a clean audit log view for the Super Admin and including new Super Admin functionalities like resetting passwords or adding universities to the system. My slide deck is also found in Sprint5Explanations to see updated Admin guide section.

I also worked on making the existing admin views have more FIA branded colors and design to keep these pages cohesive with the rest of the web application.
