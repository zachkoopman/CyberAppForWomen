These tools are simple scripts that work directly on the XML files the app uses as its database. One test scans users.xml to make sure every account has checked the consent box and that the signup includes a valid UTC timestamp and IP address. Another checks eventSessions.xml so that no helper or room is double‑booked and all start and end times make sense, keeping sessions fair and within capacity. The user‑generator helper lets you quickly create sample Super Admin, University Admin, Helper or Participant accounts in users.xml for testing. Together they help maintain data quality and catch common issues before they affect real participants.
