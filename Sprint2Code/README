These tools are simple scripts that work directly on the XML files the app uses as its database. One test scans users.xml to make sure every account has checked the consent box and that the signup includes a valid UTC timestamp and IP address. Another checks eventSessions.xml so that no helper or room is double‑booked and all start and end times make sense, keeping sessions fair and within capacity. The user‑generator helper lets you quickly create sample Super Admin, University Admin, Helper or Participant accounts in users.xml for testing. Together they help maintain data quality and catch common issues before they affect real participants.

I spent time stepping through the ASP.NET Web Forms project manually, signing up, logging in and moving through the Participant, University Admin and Super Admin pages to catch rough edges. During this process I noticed issues such as missing consent validation on the sign‑up page and date/time problems in the event scheduling screens, and made the necessary code tweaks and XML updates to fix them. I also collaborated on the home screen redesign; those photo‑filled boxes you see on the participant dashboard are a result of us working together to pick images that reflect the themes of the cyber fair and laying them out cleanly on the page.
