These are my contributions for sprint two!


The FIA CyberSec system uses several XML data stores that together define its users, courses and events. users.xml lists account details (ID, role, email, hashed password, university and timestamps) for participants, helpers and administrators, which the app reads for authentication and role‑based access control. microcourses.xml is a catalogue of course modules; each entry includes the course ID, title, description, duration, tags and, optionally, IDs of required certification rules. Those rules live in certificationRules.xml, where each rule sets a passing score, minimum practice sessions, expiry period and other criteria for helpers to be certified. events.xml holds the high‑level event records (ID, university, name, date and description). eventCourses.xml links events to their offered courses and indicates whether each course is enabled, while eventSessions.xml schedules specific sessions by event and course with start and end times, location, facilitator and capacity. Together, these files provide a lightweight data model for the platform’s accounts, training content and event management.
