Our team will deliver a web-based MVP for FIA that guides digitally visible women from a brief pre-survey to tailored booth recommendations and mentor pairing, presented in a welcoming, non-technical, trauma-informed UX. These booths will contain “bite-sized” cybersecurity info targeted at keeping women safe online rather than just providing generic cybersecurity advice. The product turns researcher-provided cybersecurity and psychological-safety content into plain-language, supports role-based flows (participant, mentor, organizer), and keeps data collection minimal with consent-first practices (clear data use, limited retention, encryption). Optional Zoom/chat and a rule-based guidance fallback ensure users can get help even when mentor capacity is tight. The MVP scope includes the pre-event survey and matching logic, virtual “booths” with saved progress, mentor availability and scheduling, lightweight admin tools for content and roles, responsive accessibility-focused UI, and basic analytics for learning what works. Expected outcomes are a pilot-ready product that measurably increases women’s safety online, technical documentation and UX mockups, organization of the already existing cybersecurity files/work, and a short final presentation on architecture, learnings, and next steps.
