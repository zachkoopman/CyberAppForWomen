This is where Zachary's Contributions for the project are found!

Sprint One: For my sprint one database file, you will have to click more pages on GitHub as you scroll down as there were lots of inventoried files

Sprint Two: For my sprint two work, locate the Sprint2Code folder in this branch to see my files and explanations. I have also created a slideshow detailing how the application works step by step and a document detailing each page of the code. These are also found in the Sprint2Code's Sprint2Explanation subfolder. These technically weren't apart of my tasks for this sprint, but I thought they would be beneficial for showing off our work so far and maintaing a foundation of knowledge for all members of what we have accomplished so far!

Sprint Three: For my sprint three work, locate the Sprint3Code folder in this branch to see my files and explanations. I have also added onto the sprint 2 slideshow detailing how the application works step by step and a document detailing each page of the code. These are also found in the Sprint3code's Sprint3Explanation subfolder. These technically weren't apart of my tasks for this sprint, but I thought they would be beneficial for showing off our work so far and maintaing a foundation of knowledge for all members of what we have accomplished so far!

Sprint Four: For my sprint four work, locate the Sprint4Code folder in this branch to see my files and explanations. I have also added onto the sprint 3 slideshow detailing how the application works step by step and a document detailing each page of the code. These are also found in the Sprint4code's Sprint4SlideDeck subfolder
