This is my Sprint 3 code contribution which helps develop the quiz that participants take before entering the application. It also includes a clean widget for displaying the score to participants.

Note: Sprint 3 has been updated to also include the xml files for the quiz as this was not originally put in.

My slide deck can be viewed in Sprint3Explanations which is a guide for users of the application that showcases all current workflows.
