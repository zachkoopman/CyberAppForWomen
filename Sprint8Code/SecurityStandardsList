Task #239
Security Standards and Sensitive Data List

Project: CyperAppForWomen
Framework: ASP.NET Web Forms (.NET Framework 4.7)

1. Purpose

This document defines the security standards followed by the CyperAppForWomen web application and clearly identifies what data is considered sensitive within the system.

The goal is to protect user privacy, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure handling of authentication and stored information.

2. Authentication Standards

The application enforces the following authentication controls:

2.1 Password Storage

Passwords are never stored in plaintext.

Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 (Rfc2898DeriveBytes).

A unique, per-user cryptographic salt is generated at account creation.

The hashing function uses:

100,000 iterations

256-bit derived key

HMACSHA256

Only the Base64-encoded salt and hash are stored in App_Data/users.xml.

2.2 Login Validation

User login is validated by recomputing the hash using the stored salt.

Hash comparisons are performed using a constant-time comparison function to mitigate timing attacks.

Login failure messages do not reveal whether the email exists.

2.3 Session Management

Session variables are initialized only after successful authentication.

Session cookies are configured with:

HttpOnly = true

RequireSSL = true

Sliding expiration is enabled with a 30-minute timeout.

2.4 Forms Authentication

ASP.NET Forms Authentication is used.

Unauthorized users are denied access by default.

Authentication mode is configured in Web.config.

3. Authorization Standards

The application uses role-based authorization.

3.1 Default Deny Policy

<deny users="?" /> is enforced.

All anonymous access is blocked unless explicitly allowed.

3.2 Role-Based Access Control

After login, users are redirected based on their assigned role:

SuperAdmin

UniversityAdmin

Helper

Participant

Authorization logic ensures users only access pages appropriate to their role.

3.3 Restricted Directories

The App_Data folder is not publicly accessible.

IIS prevents direct HTTP access to sensitive data files.

4. Data Storage Standards
4.1 Sensitive Data Protection

No plaintext passwords are stored.

Password salts and hashes are stored separately.

Sensitive data files are stored in App_Data.

4.2 Configuration Security

Debug mode is disabled in production (debug="false").

No secrets or credentials are stored in Web.config.

4.3 File Access Controls

Sensitive XML files are stored outside public directories.

Log files are stored inside App_Data.

5. Logging Standards

The application implements security logging for audit and monitoring purposes.

5.1 Logged Events

Successful login attempts

Failed login attempts

Authentication errors

Account misconfiguration detection

5.2 Logging Protections

Logs are stored in App_Data/security.log.

Logs do not store plaintext passwords.

Logs include:

UTC timestamp

IP address

Event description

6. Privacy Standards

The application follows data minimization and confidentiality principles.

6.1 Data Minimization

Only required data fields are collected.

Passwords are never recoverable.

6.2 Confidentiality

Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

Sensitive files are protected by IIS restrictions.

Sessions expire automatically.

7. Sensitive Data List

The following data elements are classified as Sensitive Data and must be protected:

Authentication Data

Passwords

Password hashes

Password salts

Session identifiers

Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

Email addresses

Phone numbers

University affiliation

User IDs

Full names (if collected)

Notes or personal descriptions

Authorization Data

Role assignments

Administrative privileges

System Data

IP addresses (logged)

Audit logs

8. Security Compliance Summary

CyperAppForWomen enforces:

✔ Secure password hashing (PBKDF2 + salt)
✔ Role-based access control
✔ Default deny authorization model
✔ Secure cookie configuration
✔ Sensitive file protection
✔ Security event logging
✔ Protection against timing attacks

These standards collectively protect user authentication data, personal information, and system integrity.
