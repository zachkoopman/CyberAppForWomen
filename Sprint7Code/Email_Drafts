Hi [Name],

I’m Meadow Kubanski, and I’m part of the student team building FIA (Cybersecurity App for Women). We’re preparing a small pilot-style test deployment and are looking for a university partner team that can help us run a short, low-lift trial.

What we’re looking for:

* A small university team (1–3 staff/faculty/grad helpers is perfect)
* Help identifying a small set of test users (or a student org/class section) for a controlled run
* Light feedback on setup, onboarding, and the session workflow (we’ll provide a simple checklist)

What you’d get:

* A guided demo + quick-start materials
* A short pilot window (we can work around your schedule)
* A clear summary of findings and recommended improvements after the test

If this is something your team could support, could we schedule a 20–30 minute call to confirm:

* who would be involved,
* what a realistic test group looks like,
* and the best timeframe to run it?

If you’re not the right contact, I’d really appreciate a referral to whoever handles pilots, student success tools, or cybersecurity outreach programs.

Thanks,
Meadow Kubanski
FIA Project Team
